    "summary": "I have been a professional tile installer for the last thirteen years. I specialize in installing custom tile showers and floors in various resort towns and other places in the Denver Metro area. Even though this work brings me satisfaction, I have realized that I do not want to do it for the rest of my life. After throwing out my back in 2015, I needed to find a new way to apply my creativity so I came up with the idea to create a social trading app called Trade Weaver.",
